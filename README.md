There's already a plethora of resources for learning programming. However, the idea of these MicroCourses is very specific.

Early on, we want to hold tight to the original goals and intention of MicroCourses, and maintain a narrow focus, to avoid a mess.

## MicroCourses in a Nutshell

A MicroCourse is a self-contained, short (1-2 hr), hands-on, Rails-related course, that can be done by a new to intermediate developer, with the assistance of an experienced developer.

For now, MicroCourses should only teach Ruby on Rails web development and directly related topics (eg. Git, Sass, CoffeeScript).

## Holding a MicroCourse

At a meetup like RailsCamp, Dev Hub, or Rails Girls, an experienced developer would teach a MicroCourse to a small number (eg. 1 - 4) students. Rather than holding a *MicroCourse*, you'd be holding a *MicroCourses Session*. So, there could be several different MicroCourses taught at a single event, at the same time.

## Restrictions of the Environment

Since these events are free and / or relatively unstructured, people can't be depended upon to commit or prepare in advance, or to follow up afterwards. Ideally, people should be able to teach, or take, a MicroCourse, with little or no preparation.

## Every MicroCourse Should Be...

* **Short:**. It (or at least a self-contained chunk of it) can be done in an hour or two.
* **Hands On:** Students should be *doing* not *listening*
* **Rails-Related:** It has some practical lesson, specific to web development with Ruby on Rails (Git, Sass, CoffeeScript are fair game. Chef, Linux, Python, etc are probably not the focus for now).

### Ideally, a MicroCourse should also be:

* **Discrete / self-contained:** Minimal 'baggage' or dependencies in terms of prior experience / assumed knowledge / stuff to install.
* **Adaptable**. It can easily be adapted, on the fly, to varying levels of ability, from total coding beginner through to intermediate. (Perhaps courses have some 'advanced excercies' at the end or something)
* **Impromtuable**. It can be picked up by an intermediate to experienced dev, and taught impromptu, without more than a few minutes preparation.
* **Small-groupable**. It is suitable for a 1-1 environment, or a small group (eg. 2 - 4 people of relatively similar ability)
* **Pass-on-able**. Once a beginner has taken a MicroCourse, it would be awesome if they could teach, or at least assist in teaching, a future session of that MicroCourse.
* **A4-pageable**. The basic MicroCourse curriculum (excluding code) should be printable on 1-2 sheets of A4 paper. It provides the outline, the teacher fills in the detail ad hoc.
