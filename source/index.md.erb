## Microcourses in a nutshell

A microcourse is a self-contained, up-to-two-hour, hands-on, Rails-related
course, that can be done by a new to intermediate developer, with the
assistance of a more experienced developer.

Microcourses will initially teach Ruby and Rails web development and
directly related topics (e.g. Git, Sass, CoffeeScript).

### The goal of microcourses

1. To allow friendships and informal mentoring relationships to organically
   form between newbies and advanced developers. This is the primary goal.

2. To teach practical aspects of Ruby on Rails web development in a hands-on,
   succinct, fun, interactive way.

### Not the goal of microcourses

Microcourses don't aim to provide a complete solution to learning the whole
Rails stack. Textbooks, eBooks, online courses, evening courses, full time
courses all have their place.

Initially, an event might only offer a few microcourses, unrelated to each
other. This may change as we see how they work in practice.
