## MicroCourses in a Nutshell

A MicroCourse is a self-contained, short (1-2 hr), hands-on, Rails-related course, that can be done by a new to intermediate developer, with the assistance of an experienced developer.

For now, MicroCourses should only teach Ruby on Rails web development and directly related topics (eg. Git, Sass, CoffeeScript).

### The Goal of MicroCourses

1. To allow friendships and informal mentoring relationships to organically form between newbies and advanced devs. This is the primary goal.
2. To teach practical aspects of Ruby on Rails web development in a hands-on, interactive way.

### Not the Goal of MicroCourses

Initially, MicroCourses don't aim to provide a complete solution to learning the whole Rails stack. Textbooks already provide that, and it would be too ambitions a goal given the MicroCoures format & restrictions (more info futher down).

Initially, an event might only offer 5 or 6 MicroCourses, unrealated to each other. This may change as we see how MicroCourses work in practice.
