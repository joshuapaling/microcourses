#### Being a Mentor

If you'd like to be a mentor, just turn up to [Sydney Ruby on Rails DevelopmentHub](http://www.reinteractive.net/community/development_hub), and volunteer to teach. No preparation needed.

Hopefully, these will be held at other community events (RailsGirls, Rails Camp, etc) down the track, too.

#### Holding a MicroCourse

The idea is that at a meetup like RailsCamp, InstallFest, DevHub, or RailsGirls, an experienced
developer would teach a MicroCourse to a small number (e.g. 1 or 2) students.

Rather than holding a *single MicroCourse*, you'd probably be holding a *MicroCourse session*.
People could choose which course they want to take or teach, pair up, and there might be
several different individual MicroCourses run at the same time.

Both mentors and students could just turn up with no preparation, and be involved.

#### I'd like to be involved in this project

Great! Fork the project on GitHub and write a course. Or get in touch if you have any other ideas / feedback.
