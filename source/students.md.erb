So, you want to learn more about Ruby / Rails? Welcome!

#### Who are these resources for?

The resources on this site aren't indented as do-it-yourself courses. They're intended as guides for mentors to hold one-to-one sessions with students.

#### Then how do I take a MicroCourse?

Just come to the free, monthly [Sydney Ruby on Rails DevelopmentHub](http://www.reinteractive.net/community/development_hub), and ask a mentor to take you through a course! This project is still young, and we're just starting to develop courses. We'd love you to try out a course and give us feedback.

#### But I'm not in Sydney...

Sorry :-(

As we get more organised and develop more courses, we aim to have these MicroCourses taught at more Ruby community events, in more places.

#### I'd like to be involved in this project

Great! You don't have to be experienced with Ruby to help out. Newcomers can help by giving us ideas for topics they find confusing, and by taking a course and giving us feedback on what worked, what didn't, and how to improve.
