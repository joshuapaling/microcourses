title: Holding a microcourse
---

At a meetup like RailsCamp, InstallFest, DevHub, or RailsGirls, an experienced
developer would teach a microcourse to a small number (e.g. 1 - 4) students.
Rather than holding a *microcourse*, you'd be holding a *microcourse session*.
People could choose which course they want to take or teach, and there might be
several different microcourses run at the same time.
