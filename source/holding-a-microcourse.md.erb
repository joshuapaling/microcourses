title: Holding A Microcourse

## <%= current_page.data.fetch("title"){""}.to_s %>

At a meetup like RailsCamp, Dev Hub, or Rails Girls, an experienced developer would teach a MicroCourse to a small number (eg. 1 - 4) students. Rather than holding a *MicroCourse*, you'd be holding a *MicroCourses Session*. People could choose which course they want to take / teach,and there might be several different MicroCourses run at the same time.
